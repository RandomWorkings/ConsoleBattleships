## Main Developers MÃ©moire

This project was my first C# project.
It was also my first attempt at following coding principles better, specifically SOLID and Behaviour Driven Development.
I was also trying to be Agile in my approach but ended up going alot more Cowboy Coder...
As such it's quite rough code, even if it does get the job done.

There were a few things I could have done better and I hope I successfully took these learnings into later projects

When it came to designing a program I needed to:
- Put more effort into define WHAT needed to happen in a system.
- Properly name the elements for readability, rather than thinking them up on the spot.
-	Review and improve my designs regularly, especially when during implementation an improvement was identified.

During Implementation I needed to:
- Stick to one main task per Phase/Stage.
- Finish tasks, not just start more.
  - Exception: Critical bugs or broken code fixes.
- Add any identified tasks to my backlog so I could pick them up in the next Phase/Stage.
- Keep an eye on the readability of my code.
- Designed a classes' Unit Tests BEFORE implementing the class.
- Version control my code properly, commits should tell the story of code implementation and refactoring.
- Simplify code but don't over-engineer solutions, or fall pray to being too DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
